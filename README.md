# MSc Course Risk-Management

As part of my MSc in Decision Analysis and Data Science, the following assignments were completed as part of the Risk Management course.

## Assignment 1: Overview and application
In this assignment, you should read Hopkin (2017) and write a paper in which you describe an application problem of your own choice, but of a reasonable size, and document the application of a thorough risk management process to the chosen problem (1350-2250 words).

Hopkin, P. (2017). Fundamentals of Risk Management: Understanding, Evaluating and Implementing Effective Risk Management. London: Kogan Page.

## Assignment 2: Evaluating Methods
Based on your own choice of literature, possibly including Hopkin (2017), explain three alternative risk analytical methods, both informally and formally, and apply them to the same problem as in the previous assignment. Argue why one solution would be better than the others and whether the choice of method is important at all, using the aforementioned application as grounds for your argument (1350-2250 words).

## Assignment 3: Applicability of Risk Management

Read Cox (2009, 2011) and then write a critical reflection on the applicability of risk management processes analysis, including the assumptions involved regarding the models (1350-2250 words)). In the paper, you should try to answer questions such as: Are the results valid? Are the methods realistic and applicable? Why, why not? How can we know this and what does it mean for the solutions in assignment 1 and 2?

You should use the information given in the articles by Cox (2009, 2011) as the main grounds for the critical reflection. Hence it's important to try to make sense of the main points of the articles before writing the critical reflection.

## Assignment 4: Financial Risk Management

Read Sweeting, P. (2011): "Financial Enterprise Risk Management". Chapters 7, 14, 15, 16 and 20. 

A1: Choose one of the case studies in Chapter 20 and based on the lessons learnt, apply a thorough financial risk management process to the given problem and document it. 

A2: Criticize your approach and report the risk methodological flaws and weaknesses. 

B1: Write a critical review of another student's solution (225-450 words) 

The length of the paper should be 1350-2250 words. The risk management process and critique should make up the bulk of the paper.

## Assignment 5: Global Risk Management

Describe the situation presented at https://rsf.org/en/ranking, and perform a thorough risk analysis of it, including various possible effects in shorter and longer terms. Use the literature of the previous assignments and/or scientific sources to support your work. Make your reasoning explicit and provide a thorough discussion of your assumptions, method and result (1350-2250 words).
